## Web Distributions

Here you can find the latest web-ready distributions of discord.js. These distributions will allow you to run discord.js
in your browser, which is very useful for making on-the-go bots or clients. For some reason, request times are also much
shorter in browsers, so your bots will reply much faster.

Web Distributions aren't always fully functional, and sometimes catching errors is a pain. As discord.js's support for
browserifying is still maturing, please don't expect that it will work out of the box just yet.

Also, if the versions in this folder are out-dated, you can always run `grunt web` to generate the latest library.
